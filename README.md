# What is my mindset?
“What is my mindset?” is a quiz app built to help teachers assess their mindset by answering a series of “true” or “false” questions. I designed and developed the app to have an engaging, intuitive and rewarding user interface. Using an interactive flashcard design to guide the user through questions, I was able to create a familiar educational setting when displaying quiz results.

## Live Preview
Live version no longer available. (Sep 2016)

## (No) Build Steps
Due to the app's simple purpose, I decided to keep everything concise: just simply open up `index.html` in a browser, or view the live preview.

## Tools
This app was built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. SCSS was compiled using the Sass preprocessor, and Angular.js was used as the framework for the quiz functionality. This project was assigned to me as a front end development challenge, to help demonstrate my ability in writing logically organized and appropriately documented code.
