# PERTS Coding Challenge
Front End Developer challenge for PERTS. (August 2016)

## Live Preview
A live version of this coding challenge can be viewed [here](http://payamyousefi.com/perts-challenge/).

## (No) Build Steps
Due to the app's simple purpose, I decided to keep everything concise: just simply open up `index.html` in a browser, or view the live preview.

## Tools
All code for this challenge was written in Atom (JavaScript) and Coda 2 (HTML, CSS). SCSS was compiled using the Sass preprocessor. The final app was tested for cross-browser compatibility using the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and IE (using Parallels VM).

## Initial Design
My first thoughts were to implement a flashcard user interface, being something any educator would quickly recognize. I started developing as I brainstormed, so I have no initial wireframe designs to present for this app.

## Thanks!
